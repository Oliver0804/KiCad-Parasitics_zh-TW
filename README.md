# KiCad-Parasitics

... Documentation is still being created

Plugin to analyze the wires in the PCB editor. To use the plugin, two points must be marked on the board. This is best two pads that are connected with a wire. The tool then determines the DC resistance between the two points. A parasitic inductance wired also estimated. In future versions, the parasitic capacitance to the ground plane will be determined.
